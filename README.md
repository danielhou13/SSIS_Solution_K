## CSV Files 

CSV files are stored in the "data" folder.

## Database Setup/Restore

All database setup files are located in the `database` folder. Inside includes a setup.sql folder used to intialize the database on local (with the appropriate name instead of `{FirstName_LastName}`).
A backup folder and file is included to restore the database called "KoreAssignment_Daniel_hou.bak".

There is also a folder of stored procedures used to clean the staging table; however, the full database backup will include all stored procedures used.
